## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability please
[open a new issue](https://github.com/P5-wrapper/next/issues/new)
with the label `security`. Security issues are a priority, and we aim to resolve
them within 48 hours. If a security vulnerability cannot be resolved by us, we
will raise the issue upstream with relevant parties such as 3rd party package
managers.
